Re: {3}
Dear Hiring Manager,
	I’m committed to becoming a Software Developer and I’ve won Hackathons to prove it! I have experience working as a Software Developer as well as a Data Scientist. I’ve worked with technologies and languages such as MySQL, Node.js, Express.js, ejs, C, C++, Java, Python, Git as well as unit testing platforms such as JUnit. I have strong experience programming applications as well as designing and implementing databases with which I could help Splunk develop software!
	To complement my technical abilities, I have strong communication and interpersonal skills. For example, I recently participated in a forty-eight hour software development competition hosted by the City of Vancouver in which my team placed in the top three. We were tasked with developing software to reduce vehicle collisions. I talked with road users and City of Vancouver engineers to better understand what roadside issues needed resolving. We then developed a responsive solution and delivered presentation to a panel of judges. We achieved this ranking because we communicated with stakeholders, worked as a group and solved a real problem.
	Interning at {4} would be a valuable opportunity to learn from software developers established in their field as well as an opportunity to learn about the mining industry. I look forward to discussing how I could contribute to the firm.
I greatly appreciate your consideration and hope to hear from you soon.
Sincerely,
{1}
